python obfuscation
obfuscation is a really important practice to follow before deploying software in the public domain as it will keep your code base safe and make it difficult to understand, and it will definitely be difficult to be copied as compared to just normal code.
The reason for this is as Python is gaining popularity, more and more proprietary projects are being developed, and storing the code base of such software without encryption can be very dangerous for the softwareâ€™s developers, and it needs to be secured.

Obfuscation will provide some layer of security to our code anyways, there is no possible way to obfuscate Python code in a way that it cannot be deobfuscated, but something is always better than nothing.
