Basic authentication in python flask.
Flask-HTTPAuth is a Flask extension that simplifies the use of HTTP authentication with Flask routes.

Sure, here's a restructured version of your README for Python Flask basic authentication:

# Python Flask Basic Authentication

This README guide will show you how to implement basic authentication in your Python Flask application using the Flask-BasicAuth extension. Basic authentication is a simple way to restrict access to specific routes based on a username and password.

## Installation

First, install the Flask-BasicAuth extension using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask-BasicAuth
```

## Configuration

In your Flask application, import and configure Flask-BasicAuth:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_basicauth import BasicAuth

app = Flask(__name)

# Configure BasicAuth
app.config['BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME'] = 'your_username'
app.config['BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD'] = 'your_password'

basic_auth = BasicAuth(app)
```

Replace `'your_username'` and `'your_password'` with your desired username and password.

## Protecting Routes

You can protect specific routes by using the `@basic_auth.required` decorator. For example:

```python
@app.route('/secure')
@basic_auth.required
def secure_route():
    return "This is a secure route that requires authentication."
```

In this example, the `/secure` route is protected with basic authentication. Only users who provide the correct username and password will have access.

## Running the Application

Run your Flask application as usual, typically with the following code at the end of your script:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Now, when you access the `/secure` route, you'll be prompted to enter your username and password. If your credentials match what you've configured, you'll gain access to the protected route.
